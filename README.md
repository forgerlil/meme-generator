Workshop brief: 

Your Mission

Build a Meme Factory! You can use the imgflip API to get some meme images to work on (https://api.imgflip.com/).

Thereâ€™s an option to provide quote text directly with the API; but we want to build our own UI around the concept, so weâ€™re not going to use that ðŸ™‚

Of course, youâ€™re free to use another API if you find this one to be too limiting to your taste!

Level 1:

    Get some meme pictures from imgflip. Select the first one to be the current meme picture
    Allow the user to write some meme text at the top and bottom of that picture, in a meme style 
    Position that text over the current picture. Hint: use the Impact font or something similar to make your text look meme-like ðŸ™‚ (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp)
    Allow the user to change the current picture (randomly or with back/next buttons)

Level 2:

    Allow the user to upload their own picture to create a meme (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File/Using_files_from_web_applications, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL)
    Make sure the text does not overflow from the picture

Level 3:

    Find a way to export that meme as a real picture (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-to-image), the useRef hook might come in handy here (https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref) 
    Implement a reset button to remove the generated picture from the DOM (if you injected it in the DOM) and/or clean the user input


Features and things learned in this workshop:

1. Usage of Axios to fetch a RESTful API
2. useState to pass input values to HTML tags
2. Exporting of images using useRef
